# winForm-custom-controls
Visual studio was having issues with getting custom controls from dll files so I uploaded it directly.
Feel free to use and modify according to your needs.
# Custom TextBox

use getText() and setText() methods for getting text from the textBox and setting the text on the textbox programatically.
You can set the textBoxBackColor property to the same as the form color in it's background to make it pseudo-invisible.
